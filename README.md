This is a copy of my first larger project during my retraining program.
My contributions include the basic structure of the model classes as well as large parts of the TicketController and the associated views.
File upload, the comment functionality, and the visual design of the views were handled by fellow trainees.

A total of four people were involved in this project.
We had about two and a half weeks for planning, implementation, and presentation.
Except for the basic MVC structure, no scaffolding was used.

Use the following demo accounts:
Username: "BjSa" (or "Admin" for extended functionality)
Password: "Secret123$"
